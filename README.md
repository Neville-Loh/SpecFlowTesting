## BDD testing 
Scenarios focus on the expected behaviors of the product. Each scenario focuses on one specific thing. Behaviors are described in plain language, and any ambiguity can be clarified with a simple conversation or Example Mapping. There’s no unreadable code or obscure technical jargon, and there’s no game of telephone. Clarity ensures the customer gets what the customer wants.

BDD also is designed to speed up the development process. Everyone involved in development relies upon the same scenarios. Scenarios are requirements, acceptance criteria, test cases, and test scripts all in one – there is no need to write any other artifact. The modular nature of Gherkin syntax expedites test automation development. Furthermore, scenarios can be used as steps to reproduce failures for defect reports.
